	<h3>
		The challenge
	</h3>
	<p>
		Build a dependable inter-city commute solution which is affordable, safe and convenient. Existing transportation services fail to deliver upon the promises they make and the experience of booking a inter-city cab is below par. Existing services don't provide up front clarity on what user's travel expense would be and often people end up frustrated in dealing with local travel agencies. In case of a break down or emergencies local travel agencies fail to deliver.

	<h3>
		My role
	</h3>
	<p>
		Ola Outstation is built for frequent commuters who travel inter-city for business or vacation purposes. I studied existing transportation systems and mapped out a user journey of potential consumers to identify their pain points and figure out what success means to them. This helped me in setting up meetings with stakeholders and understand how business will help address those concerns and what success means for business.
	</p>
	<p>
		I then regularly made end to end mockups and tested them with daily commuters to get clarity. After which
		I showed best possible approach to stakeholders and senior designers and took feedback. This iterative approach helped me ship out a world-class product which is now being used by millions of users daily. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It took us 1 month to role out the MVP and another month to improve
		upon our product. I was the sole designer on this and currently looking after it.

	<h3>
		Design planning
	</h3>
	<p>
		To build a dependable service I laid out a proper plan that will guide me towards clarity. From my previous experience of building Ola Shuttle I learned that the earlier I get feedback from users and stakeholders the better it is. I kept everybody associate with Outstation in loop and navigated them through my plan to reach desired outcome.

<blockquote>
    We obsessed over making Shuttle easy and intuitive to use. To come up with a clear vision and flow was a challenge, and to make sure we hadn’t left out any idea, we went through twenty end to end prototypes of the app, exploring different flows thoroughly and picking out the best solution to make the final product.
</blockquote>
<h3>
    UX process
</h3>
<p>
    When you work on a product like Shuttle, that has to be built from scratch, there are thousands of ideas floating and you have to make a well informed decision, articulate and justify it too. It's a critical situation, because the success of the product depends on the direction you take it into.

 Prototype

<p>We obssessed on making a perfect flow for our users, this is one of them divided into different tasks that a user will go through while interacting with the product.</p>

<h3>
    Shuttle V.1, MVP
</h3>
<p>
    After spending countless hours on building end to end flows, debating over thousands of design challenges, we came to a consensus. We went ahead with the easiset flow possible, one that helps user book quickly, track the bus and get on it effortlessly. It takes a lot to build a product. Building a service that would go on to serve a billion people was nerve wracking. 
<p>
    We were proud to ship out a well thought product with the following features.
</p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Route discovery</li>
    <li>Stop selection</li>
    <li>Schedule of the buses</li>
    <li>Route directions</li>
    <li>Comfortable seats</li>
    <li>A/C in the shuttle</li>
    <li>Tracking of the shuttle in real time</li>
    <li>Information of the pickup and drop stops</li>
    <li>Ability for users to buy passes and travel without making a booking daily</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Usability testing
</h3>
<p>
    We wanted to make sure that the on-ground experience was as good as the in-app experience. The entire journey had four important states. We wanted to do a usability testing around those states and ask the right questions. We flew down to Gurgaon and did usability testing. We observed how users were interacting with the service. 
</p>
<p>
    The results weren’t obvious, there was a lot of scope for improvement.

<h3>
    Problems identified
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>On a bad network users had to wait for the rate and review screen to come if they haven't rated yet, hence making booking process slow</li>
    <li>Too many messages upon booking, 4 different types - 1 email & 3 text messages</li>
    <li>Meta search was out of place. Users were unable to search for popular stops, ex - 'snapdeal' which is a popular stop was showing a different result</li>
    <li>There was no feedback on tapping certain actions on the screen</li>
    <li>Most people were travelling daily and booking a ticket daily was adding a task to their daily routine</li>
    <li>On-spot booking users didn't care about the map, they knew their spots and wanted the system to match their speed</li>
    <li>Discovery of different routes running in the city was an issue</li>
    <li>Introductory screens didn't help, people went straight ahead into booking without noticing them</li>
    <li>On slow speed networks app failed to respond</li>    
</ul>

    Our on ground experience helped us understand our product better. There were a lot of shortcomings that needed to be fixed. With our assumptions and findings we went ahead and articulated a flow and shipped version 2.

<h3>
    1. Pre-Journey
</h3>
<p>
    Most of our users were booking an Ola shuttle from the pickup stop and were not concerned about the maps while booking a Shuttle.Therefore we removed the map, and asked a simple question, “Where do you want to go?”.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, we solved the problem for route discovery. Earlier people couldn’t discover different routes. Now, they are able to see all nearby routes along with when the next shuttle is arriving and the nearest stop they can board from.
</p>
<p class="full-width" style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/final1.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""></p>

<h3>
    2. Booking
</h3>
<p>
    Users can easily pick their desired type of ticket. They can go for a regular ticket or a pass. To motivate users to go for the pass we had the pricing comparison upfront with the value they will get out of it. Upon scrolling down they can see the map as well.
</p>
<p class="full-width" style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/final2.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""></p>

<h3>
    3. Boarding
</h3>
<p>
    We realized people wanted the shuttle to be flexible, i.e if they can’t make it to their scheduled shuttle, then there should be a convenient way to see the upcoming shuttle and re-schedule the ride.
</p>
<p>
    Also it should be easy enough for users to cancel, track and scan their ticket upon boarding the shuttle, hence, we added the actions right on their pass.
</p>
<p class="full-width" style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/final3.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""></p>

<h3>
    4. Return travel
</h3>
<p>
    We realized people wanted the shuttle to be flexible, i.e if they can’t make it to their scheduled shuttle, then there should be a convenient way to see the upcoming shuttle and re-schedule the ride.
</p>
<p>
    Also it should be easy enough for users to cancel, track and scan their ticket upon boarding the shuttle, hence, we added the actions right on their pass.
</p>
<p class="full-width" style="text-align:center;"><img src="{{ '/assets/img/final4.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""></p>

<h3>Business Impact</h3>
<p>
    Shuttle created a great business market for Ola. It is an important part of the team as it 
    helped to accquire a new segment of customers. The cab market did not address the problems
     of connecting Metro feeder routes for daily commuters.
</p>
<p> 
    Shuttle created a market of its own and and solved daily commute for millions of users. Currently operational in 6 cities.

<h3>User Impact</h3>
<p>
    Our users wanted a cheaper and 
    reliable option that is comfortable and helps boost their productivity. In Gurgaon where traffic is beyond
    limits, Ola Shuttle helped releave traffic congestion as more and more customers left their own transportation
    mediums and travelled with us making commute easier for everyone.
