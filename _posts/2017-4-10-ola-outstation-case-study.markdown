	<h3>
		The challenge
	</h3>
	<p>
		Build a dependable inter-city commute solution which is affordable, safe and convenient. Existing transportation services fail to deliver upon the promises they make and the experience of booking a inter-city cab is below par. Existing services don't provide up front clarity on what user's travel expense would be and often people end up frustrated in dealing with local travel agencies. In case of a break down or emergencies local travel agencies fail to deliver.

	<h3>
		My role
	</h3>
	<p>
		Ola Outstation is built for frequent commuters who travel inter-city for business or vacation purposes. I studied existing transportation systems and mapped out a user journey of potential consumers to identify their pain points and figure out what success means to them. This helped me in setting up meetings with stakeholders and understand how business will help address those concerns and what success means for business.
	</p>
	<p>
		I then regularly made end to end mockups and tested them with frequent outstation commuters. After which
		I showed best possible approach to stakeholders and senior designers and took feedback. This iterative approach helped me ship out a world-class product which is now being used by millions of users daily. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It took us 1 month to role out the MVP and another month to improve
		upon our product. I was the sole designer on this and currently looking after it.

	<h3>
		Design planning
	</h3>
	<p>
		To build a dependable service I laid out a proper plan that will guide me towards clarity. From my previous experience of building Ola Shuttle I learned that the earlier I get feedback from users and stakeholders the better it is. I kept everybody associate with Outstation in loop and navigated them through my plan to reach desired outcome.

	<h3>
		User study
	</h3>
	<p>
		I did some primary research to figure out who are customers are and what are their goals and concerns. What is their
		motivation to use a cab service for inter-city travel.
	</p>
	<p>
		I figured out our users are frequent commuters who travel short inter-city routes like, Mumbai-Pune, Jaipur-Delhi, Delhi-Agra etc for business or vacation. These users are looking for a comfortable, dependable, and affordable solution.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here are a few questions that I asked our users to chart down their existing user journey:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-of-items">
		<li>How do you find out about a outstation service in your city?</li>
		<li>How do you figure out about pricing and its details?</li>
		<li>Do you compare prices with other services?</li>
		<li>Do you care about a car type; luxury, sedan or SUV?</li>
		<li>Do you care about additional services like, A/C and Wi-Fi?</li>
		<li>Do you have any concerns while traveling?</li>
		<li>Do you travel one ways or return?</li>
		<li>How do you pay for your travel?</li>
	</ul>

	<p><b>The above set of questions helped us map the current user journey and its challenges.</b></p>
