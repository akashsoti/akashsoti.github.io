<h3>Business Brief</h3>
<p>
  Establish brand presence and make it easier for the users to understand what Punchh can do for their business
</p>
<p>
  Make life easier for users. Users already have so much to handle when they enter a restaurant. The Punchh app should be built in a way so that the most essential things, punching and redeeming restaurant cards, are fast and straightforward.
</p>

<h3>My role</h3>
<p>
  I started out by studying the existing website to identify areas for improvement. Being a designer at Punchh, I knew the most important selling points of Punchh and how the system works. I started by creating wireframes and sketches, took feedback at regular intervals from stakeholders, and later hand-coded the entire thing into a responsive website.
</p>
<p>
  I used HAML, SASS and Ruby on Rails to make my code DRY, readable and easy for collaboration.
</p>

<h3>Understand, explore, articulate, repeat</h3>
<p>
  more coming soon...
