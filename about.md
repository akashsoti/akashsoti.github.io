				Building human-centered products from 2012, currently a UX designer at Amazon India where I am leading the user experience for Amazon Business Marketplace and the India Retail Wholesale, Amazon Distribution. 
			</p><br>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				I started off as a Ruby on Rails developer and soon realised I am missing an important piece in building human-centered products. Product design for me was a natural transition as it enabled me to design and makes app which are truly customer backwards. 
			</p><br>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				For me, design is a marriage of creative and technical, these two are not separate. Design leads development and development informs design.
			</p><br>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				The ability to code and ship things enabled me to understand the intricacies of product design and helped me make better products with clear vision.
			</p>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;" >
				My mission is to make things that are obvious in nature and help people achieve their goals.
