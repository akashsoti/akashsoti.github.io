				With close to 11 years of experience in design and a track record of working with notable startups like Punchh.com and Ola Cabs, my focus since 2012 has been on building human-centered products. Currently, as a Sr. UX designer at Amazon India, I lead the user experience for Alexa experiences and help the India central design team with new initiatives.

			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				My journey began as a Ruby on Rails developer, but I soon realized that I was missing a critical aspect of building products that centered around the user. This realization led me to transition to product design, which allowed me to create experiences that were truly customer-focused. 
			</p><br>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				In my view, design is a harmonious blend of creativity and technical knowledge. These two elements are not mutually exclusive. Instead, design guides development, while development informs design. My ability to code and ship products has given me a better understanding of product design, enabling me to create better products with a clear vision.
			</p><br>
			<p style="margin: 0 auto 0 0; width:100%;">
				My ultimate goal is to design products that are intuitive and user-friendly, helping people achieve their objectives with ease.
